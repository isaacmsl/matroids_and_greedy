# Matroids and Greedy Algorithms

The code developed here was used in a class of [Mathematical Foundations of Computing Tutoring Project](https://fmc.imd.ufrn.br/) at Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN). The aim of the class was to show the theory behind Matroid and its relation with Greedy Algorithms. The inspiration was [this paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I7QdOlK8IH_Ko_GXrNVOF596G4OarIlq/view) produced by [MathGurl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NZO9fgSED).
